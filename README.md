## Project Description

The NYUAD hackathon is an event that brings people with diverse talents and experiences together to cooperate and produce innovative solutions to specific challenges or problems. It is usually held over a few days, during which time participants work in groups to create prototypes or projects that meet the stated issue. The hackathon promotes creativity, experimentation, and teamwork, and it frequently draws people from various industries such as technology, design, and business. The event may offer a one-of-a-kind opportunity for networking, learning, and displaying new ideas.

The hackathon includes a range of events designed to encourage participants' creativity, problem-solving skills, and collaboration. Workshops, mentorship sessions, and keynote speeches from industry leaders. Participants form teams and work on their projects during the hackathon, which culminates in a final project exhibition and judgment. Prizes are also given to the top-performing teams. 

The project team will utilize a combination of filming and web design to document the hackathon event. Hana and Soumen are in charge of shooting the event, capturing crucial moments, and conducting participant interviews. In addition, Hana will also be participating in the hackathon. Majid and Abraiz are in charge of web design and video editing to provide website users with an interesting and immersive experience.

The website's design revolves around providing an immersive experience that represents the hackathon event's enthusiasm, creativity, and collaboration. The project team intends to build a platform that will exhibit crucial events from the event.

## Process

The project team began by exploring ideas for properly documenting the hackathon event. The team investigated various themes and narrative approaches to capture the essence of the event and provide an engaging experience for website visitors.

Following careful consideration, the team decided to concentrate on the following key aspects of the event:

Participant Interviews: Each interviewee is asked various questions that aim to gain insight into their experience during the hackathon. Questions focused on where they are from, their role in the team, their idea process, the technical skills they utilized, and the challenges they faced. Participants shared their thoughts on the collaborative atmosphere and how they were able to learn from one another. 

Final presentations: The project team intends to record the final presentations, during which participants demonstrate their projects and offer their answers to a panel of judges. Visitors to the website will gain insight into the innovative solutions developed by the participants by viewing the final presentations.

Award Ceremony: The hackathon will also feature an award ceremony to recognize the top-performing teams. The judges will evaluate the projects based on criteria such as creativity, technical complexity, and potential impact. The winning teams will be announced and awarded prizes at the end of the event. The award ceremony also provides an opportunity to showcase the achievements of the participants and acknowledge their hard work and dedication throughout the event.

## Reflection/Evaluation

We believe that our documentary captured the essence of the hackathon event. Through our visual and audio recordings, we were able to highlight the participants' creativity, technical skills, and collaborative spirit.

Furthermore, our editing process enabled us to create a cohesive and engaging storyline that effectively conveyed the hackathon's excitement and energy. The utilization of interviews, time-lapse film, and close-up images contributed to a more complete picture of the event and its participants.

We also wish to acknowledge the difficulties we had while filming and editing, such as technical issues and time limits. Despite these challenges, we were able to complete the project and meet our initial expectations and goals.

Overall, we believe that our video captures the heart of the hackathon event and gives viewers significant insights into the creative and collaborative process of generating new solutions to real-world problems. We hope that our documentary motivates others to attend hackathons and pursue their own creative activities.
